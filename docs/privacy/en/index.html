                <p><em>pursuant to art. 13 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) regarding the processing of personal data</em></p>
                <p><em>With this information, we explain to all USERS what information is collected and how it is managed.</em></p>
                <p><strong>DATA CONTROLLER</strong></p>
                <p>The data controller is the calcio&rivoluzione collective as owner of the site and promoter of the initiative who can be contacted via e-mail address: ilcalcioboicottaisraele@krutt.org</p>
                <p><strong>LEGAL BASIS, PURPOSE AND STORAGE</strong></p>
                <p>Each processing must be based on a suitable legal basis.</p>
                <p>The processing in question has as its object the publication of signatures adhering to the appeal detailed on the site.</p>
                <p>If a user wants to be among the signatories of the appeal, he must leave his data, otherwise it will not be possible to satisfy his request.</p>
                <p>Also for this reason, the legal basis is to be found in the fulfillment of a contractual request/obligation as provided for by art. 6 c.1 b GDPR. The member's data will be kept for public viewing for 2 years from signature, unless a further legal basis arises.</p>
                <p><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO PROVIDE DATA</strong></p>
                <p>The user, as highlighted above, is in no way obliged to provide us with his personal data.</p>
                <p>However, the provision of data functional to the processing indicated above is necessary to allow us to satisfy a specific request. This processing does not require consent, but any refusal to provide such data will result in the impossibility of providing the service.</p>
                <p><strong>TYPE OF DATA PROCESSED</strong></p>
                <p>The data processed are only those collected via the contact form and therefore, personal and contact data.</p>
                <p><strong>TO WHO DO WE COMMUNICATE THE DATA?</strong></p>
                <p>Given that the object of the request consists in the publication of the signatories' data, beyond the disclosure of the same, it is possible that the data are also processed by subjects other than the owner, within the limits of what is stated below:</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO PROCESS</span>: they are internal figures, specifically volunteers and collaborators of the project in question who collect or process the data according to their respective duties and according to the profiles assigned by the owner.</p>
                <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">DATA PROCESSING PERSONS</span>: are third party collaborators who process data on behalf of the Data Controller through the stipulation of a specific Data Processor appointment agreement, by which the operations delegated to the third party are defined, as well as the security measures that the latter must adopt in order to best protect the information obtained from the Data Controller.
                    In particular, they may process your data</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email hosting service and cloud backup service;</li>
                    <li>External companies we collaborate with.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In any case, your data will not be transferred to countries outside the EU area in the absence of your explicit consent or in the absence of the guarantees for this purpose provided for by the GDPR (adequacy judgments, signing of standard clauses...).</p>
                <p>The list of third parties appointed as Data Processors is available to customers and possible future customers at the office, and may be shown to interested parties upon specific request.</p>
                <p><strong>RIGHTS OF THE INTERESTED PARTY</strong></p>
                <p>You will always have the right to obtain confirmation from the Data Controller as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and, in this case, to obtain access to the personal data and information indicated in the art. 15 GDPR.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, you are granted the right to obtain rectification, cancellation and limitation of the processing of your personal data held by the Data Controller.</p>
                <p>Finally, you are entitled to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of the Member State in which you reside/work or of the place where the alleged violation occurred.</p>
